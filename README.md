Caligrifyzone is an e-commerce web application designed to showcase and sell calligraphy-inspired artwork, with a strong focus on Arabic calligraphy and modern typographic design. The platform provides users with an intuitive shopping experience where they can browse unique art pieces, view detailed product information, and securely complete purchases. The target audience includes art enthusiasts, collectors, and gift buyers who value meaningful, culturally inspired artwork that combines tradition with contemporary design.

The rationale behind this project comes from a personal interest in calligraphy as an expressive and culturally significant art form. Arabic calligraphy, in particular, transforms language into visual art and carries deep historical and emotional value, yet it is often underrepresented in mainstream online marketplaces. Caligrifyzone was created to give this art form a dedicated digital space, making it more accessible while preserving its artistic integrity.

From a development perspective, Caligrifyzone also serves as a full-stack learning project, enabling the implementation of key e-commerce features such as product management, user authentication, secure payments, webhooks, and automated testing. This project demonstrates how technical skills can be applied to support creative expression while delivering a professional, user-focused online shopping experience.

**[Wireframes](#wireframes)** (see below)

#### 5. Surface

**Visual Design Elements**
- **[Colours](#colour-scheme)** (see below)
- **[Typography](#typography)** (see below)

### Colour Scheme

Caligrifyzone uses a refined, modern colour palette that balances dark, elegant tones with soft neutrals and vibrant accents, reflecting the artistic nature of calligraphy while maintaining strong usability and accessibility.

The primary interface is built around dark and muted colours, such as near-black backgrounds and soft greys ('#000000', '#333333', '#3a3a3a'), which create a gallery-style atmosphere that allows the artwork to stand out. Text is predominantly rendered in light grey ('#ccc') to ensure comfortable readability against darker backgrounds.

Accent colours play a key role in guiding user interaction and reinforcing branding. Teal and aqua tones ('#23BBBB', '#188181', '#17a2b8') are used for links, buttons, and interactive elements, providing visual contrast and clear affordances. Lighter neutral shades such as whitesmoke ('#f5f5f5') and white ('#ffffff') are used in forms and content-heavy areas to improve readability and reduce visual fatigue.

### Typography

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all body text and other secondary text.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

## Database Design

### Data Model

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models. Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

![screenshot](documentation/erd.png)

I have used `Mermaid` to generate an interactive ERD of my project.

```mermaid

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://www.github.com/RadwanDuadu/Caligrifyzone/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project. Through it, EPICs, User Stories, issues/bugs, and Milestone tasks were planned, then subsequently tracked on a regular basis using the Kanban project board.

![screenshot](documentation/gh-projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/RadwanDuadu/Caligrifyzone/issues) served as an another Agile tool. There, I managed my User Stories and Milestone tasks, and tracked any issues/bugs.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into User Stories for prioritizing and implementing them. Using this approach, I was able to apply "MoSCoW" prioritization and labels to my User Stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered - required to Pass the project (*max ~60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration - future features

## Ecommerce Business Model

This site sells goods to individual customers, and therefore follows a **Business to Customer** model. It is of the simplest **B2C** forms, as it focuses on individual transactions, and doesn't need anything such as monthly/annual subscriptions.

It is still in its early development stages, although it already has a newsletter, and links for social media marketing.

Social media can potentially build a community of users around the business, and boost site visitor numbers, especially when using larger platforms such a Facebook.

A newsletter list can be used by the business to send regular messages to site users. For example, what items are on special offer, new items in stock, updates to business hours, notifications of events, and much more!

## SEO & Marketing

### Keywords

I've identified some appropriate keywords to align with my site, that should help users when searching online to find my page easily from a search engine. This included a series of the following keyword types:

- Short-tail (head terms) keywords
- Long-tail keywords

I've also played around with [Word Tracker](https://www.wordtracker.com) a bit to check the frequency of some of my site's primary keywords (only until the free trial expired).

### Sitemap

I've used [XML-Sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com) to generate a sitemap.xml file. This was generated using my deployed site URL: https://caligrifyzone-90b1cd839db0.herokuapp.com

After it finished crawling the entire site, it created a [sitemap.xml](sitemap.xml), which I've downloaded and included in the repository.

### Robots

I've created the [robots.txt](robots.txt) file at the root-level. Inside, I've included the default settings:

```txt
User-agent: *
Disallow:
Sitemap: https://caligrifyzone-90b1cd839db0.herokuapp.com/sitemap.xml
```

- [Testing the robots.txt file](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062598)

### Newsletter Marketing

I have incorporated a newsletter sign-up form on my application, to allow users to supply their email address if they are interested in learning more. 

⚠️ OPTION 1: RECOMMENDED ⚠️

**Custom Django Model Newsletter**

    ```python
    class NewsletterSubscriber(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)       # <- add this
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    subscribed_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name} ({self.email})"
    ```

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://caligrifyzone-90b1cd839db0.herokuapp.com).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), then finally, click **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables to match your private `env.py` file.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user-inserts-own-cloudinary-database-url |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user-inserts-own-postgres-database-url |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user-inserts-own-gmail-api-key |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user-inserts-own-gmail-email-address |
| `SECRET_KEY` | any-random-secret-key |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user-inserts-own-stripe-public-key |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user-inserts-own-stripe-secret-key |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user-inserts-own-stripe-webhook-secret |
| `HOST` | heroku-website-url |

Heroku needs some additional files in order to deploy properly.

- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
- [Procfile](Procfile)
- [.python-version](.python-version)

You can install this project's **[requirements.txt](requirements.txt)** (*where applicable*) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **[Procfile](Procfile)** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace `app_name` with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where `settings.py` is located*

The **[.python-version](.python-version)** file tells Heroku the specific version of Python to use when running your application.

- `3.12` (or similar)

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either (*recommended*):

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (*replace `app_name` with your app name*)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For "Primary Interest", you can choose **Programmable Media for image and video API**.
- *Optional*: edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the leading `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.
    - `cloudinary://123456789012345:AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStuVwXyZa@1a2b3c4d5)`
- This will go into your own `env.py` file, and Heroku Config Vars, using the **key** of `CLOUDINARY_URL`.

### PostgreSQL

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net) for the Relational Database with Django.

> [!CAUTION]
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Submitted my email address to the CI PostgreSQL Database link above.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.
- The Database connection string will resemble something like this:
    - `postgres://<db_username>:<db_password>@<db_host_url>/<db_name>`
- You can use the above URL with Django; simply paste it into your `env.py` file and Heroku Config Vars as `DATABASE_URL`.

### Stripe API

This project uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle the ecommerce payments.

Once you've created a Stripe account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click to expand the "Get your test API keys".
- You'll have two keys here:
	- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = Publishable Key (starts with **pk**)
	- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key (starts with **sk**)

As a backup, in case users prematurely close the purchase-order page during payment, we can include Stripe Webhooks.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click **Developers**, and select **Webhooks**.
- From there, click **Add Endpoint**.
	- `https://caligrifyzone-90b1cd839db0.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`
- Click **receive all events**.
- Click **Add Endpoint** to complete the process.
- You'll have a new key here:
	- `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` = Signing Secret (Wehbook) Key (starts with **wh**)

### Gmail API

This project uses [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) to handle sending emails to users for purchase order confirmations.

Once you've created a Gmail (Google) account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- Click on the **Account Settings** (cog icon) in the top-right corner of Gmail.
- Click on the **Accounts and Import** tab.
- Within the section called "Change account settings", click on the link for **Other Google Account settings**.
- From this new page, select **Security** on the left.
- Select **2-Step Verification** to turn it on. (*verify your password and account*)
- Once verified, select **Turn On** for 2FA.
- Navigate back to the **Security** page, and you'll see a new option called **App passwords** (*search for it at the top, if not*).
- This might prompt you once again to confirm your password and account.
- Select **Mail** for the app type.
- Select **Other (Custom name)** for the device type.
    - Any custom name, such as "Django" or `Caligrifyzone`
- You'll be provided with a 16-character password (API key).
    - Save this somewhere locally, as you cannot access this key again later!
    - If your 16-character password contains *spaces*, make sure to remove them entirely.
    - `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` = user's 16-character API key
    - `EMAIL_HOST_USER` = user's own personal Gmail email address

### WhiteNoise

This project uses the [WhiteNoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to aid with static files temporarily hosted on the live Heroku site.

To include WhiteNoise in your own projects:

- Install the latest WhiteNoise package:
    - `pip install whitenoise`
- Update the `requirements.txt` file with the newly installed package:
    - `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Edit your `settings.py` file and add WhiteNoise to the `MIDDLEWARE` list, above all other middleware (apart from Django’s "SecurityMiddleware"):

```python
# settings.py

MIDDLEWARE = [
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
    # any additional middleware
]
```


### Local Development

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level, and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user-inserts-own-postgres-database-url")
os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user-inserts-own-cloudinary-database-url")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user-inserts-own-gmail-host-api-key")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user-inserts-own-gmail-email-address")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "any-random-secret-key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user-inserts-own-stripe-public-key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user-inserts-own-stripe-secret-key")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user-inserts-own-stripe-webhook-secret")  # only if using Stripe Webhooks

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` (*Windows/Linux*) or `⌘+C` (*Mac*)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run` then `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate --plan` then `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (*if applicable*): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (*repeat for each file*)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*
- **NOTE**: You should never make a backup of the default *admin* or *users* data with confidential information.

#### Cloning
